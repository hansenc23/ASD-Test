Feature: TopUpManagementFeature
    As a user of Opal project 
    I want to create payment method
    So that I can top up my card with my payment method

    Scenario: My first test
        Given I am on the main page
        When I fill in "Username" with "<username>"
        And I fill in "Password" with "<password>"
        Then I should be on the main page
